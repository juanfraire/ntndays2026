# NTN Days 2026 website

Static one-page site for NTN Days 2026 (October 13-14, 2026, Cnam, Paris), served via GitHub Pages.
Live at https://ntndays.space/ once the domain is moved (see below).

## Stack

Single `index.html` using Tailwind (CDN), Font Awesome (CDN), and Space Grotesk (Google Fonts).
No build step: edit, commit, push.

## Publishing and domain-move checklist

The file-side work is done in both working copies (July 2026): 2025 favicon/OG/canonical fixes and `CNAME` deletion, 2026 `CNAME` containing `ntndays.space`.
DNS at Namecheap needs no changes; the domain is reassigned on the GitHub side only, driven by the `CNAME` files.

1. Commit and push `ntndays2025` (the pushed `CNAME` deletion releases the custom domain; the 2025 site remains at https://juanfraire.github.io/ntndays2025/).
2. Commit and push `ntndays2026`, then enable GitHub Pages (Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch `main` / root). The `CNAME` file in the repo attaches `ntndays.space`.
3. In `ntndays2026` Pages settings, tick "Enforce HTTPS" once the certificate is issued (usually within minutes since DNS never changed).
4. Verify https://ntndays.space/ serves the 2026 site and the Past Editions links resolve.

## TODOs before launch

- [ ] Organizing committee list (`#committee` section)
- [ ] Sponsor list confirmation (`#sponsors` section; Cnam, GDR RSD, GDR IASIS, Inria already in)
- [ ] Talk submission and registration form links (`#submit` section, disabled "coming soon" buttons until the forms are ready)

## Edition numbering

The site says "4th Edition": 2023 IRIT/ENSEEIHT Toulouse (Oct 19-20, per irit.fr) -> 2024 Grenoble (Oct 17-18, called "deuxieme edition" by GDR IASIS) -> 2025 LAAS Toulouse -> 2026 Paris.
If there was an earlier edition not documented online, bump the hero badge in `index.html`.
